# drag and scroll
Javascript tool that uses dragging to scroll any element. Unlike other plugins this causes real scrolling instead of changing margin or position. Use this plugin as addition to default scrolling. This also works out with touch interfaces.

## Requirements
* jQuery installed

## Install
1. Include drag_n_scroll.css
2. Include drag_n_scroll.js
3. Set config (HTML-context and speed) in drag_n_scroll.js

## Demo
http://bastianowicz.github.io/drag_n_scroll/

## Multi-Usage
If you want to add multiple scrollable panes to a document just do as in the following example:

```javascript
    // drag_n_scroll on image
    var draggable = new bastianowicz.Drag_n_Scroll();
    draggable.$context = $("#myImage");     // of course you have to change the selector
    draggable.init();
```

## Support
Do you like the stuff? Use it, spread it, modify it and extend it.
